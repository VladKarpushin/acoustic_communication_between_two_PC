Acoustic communication between two PC
==========================

Goal
----

In this tutorial you will learn:

-   how to transfer information by OOK modulation
-   how to transfer information by BPSK modulation
-   how to transfer information by QPSK modulation
-   how to realise equalizer
- 	how to work with ofdm transmitter/receiver and cycle prefix(CP)

Theory
------

Offered algorithm allows acoustic communication between two PC 


Result
------

Below result is reached with BER = 0 for OOK and BPSK modulation.
Physical layer gross bitrate = 1600 [bits/s]
Net bitrate = 1327 [bits/s]
